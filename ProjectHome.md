The specifications on this page result from research done in Self-Organising Assembly Systems (SOAS). The completed formal specifications are executable in the Maude software available online:
http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu

SOAS are assembly systems that (1) participate in their own design by spontaneously organising themselves in the shop floor layout in response to the arrival of a product order and (2) manage themselves during production.

The self-organising process for SOAS to design themselves follows the Chemical Abstract Machine (CHAM) paradigm: industrial robots self-select and self-arrange according to specific chemical rules in response to a product order with generic assembly instructions (GAP). An additional set of rules describes how the robotic coalitions arrange themselves in a shop-floor layout and then how the GAP is transformed into Layout-Specific Assembly Instructions (LSAI), which is a kind of recipe for how the self-organising robots assemble the product.

The system can be be obtained either as a zipped archive from the Downloads section of this website, or browsed/checkout through SVN from the Source section of the site.
